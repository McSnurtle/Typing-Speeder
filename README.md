# Typing Speeder
Typing Speeder is a clean and minimalistic typing test software. Currently, Typing Speeder relies on Time 10 mechanics for it's WPM calculations

## modes
Time 10
The test will calculate how long it took you to type out the sentence given - your accuracy penalties (fixing mistakes does help!)

Note: for now time 10 is the only available mode, but in the future I hope to add wordcount modes, custom modes, zen modes (like monkeytype) etc,..

## customizability
In the future I plan to add various themes, custom background settings, font settings, and typing settings to change how you interact with the tests.
But unfortunately, for now I don't have the time to implement these features yet, but soon I should be able to get back to this project and polish it up a bit.
